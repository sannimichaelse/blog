# Introduction

Apache Kafka has emerged as a leading platform for data streaming and processing, allowing organizations to harness real-time data for critical insights and decision-making. However, the success of Kafka heavily relies on the efficient and reliable ingestion of data from various sources. Change Data Capture (CDC) plays a pivotal role in this process, enabling organizations to capture and track changes in databases and replicate them in Kafka. This article explores the integration of CDC with Apache Kafka and its significance in ensuring smooth and seamless data ingestion for stream processing.

# Understanding CDC (Change Data Capture)

CDC is a technique used to capture and track changes made to a database, providing a reliable and incremental approach to data synchronization. Instead of replicating entire datasets, CDC captures only the changes (inserts, updates, deletes) made to the database, reducing the processing overhead and ensuring real-time data availability. The principles of CDC involve capturing change events, maintaining data integrity, and ensuring consistency across systems.

# Apache Kafka - An Overview

Before diving into CDC integration, let's briefly explore Apache Kafka. Kafka is a distributed streaming platform designed to handle large-scale, real-time data streams. Its architecture comprises several components, including producers that publish data to Kafka topics, brokers responsible for data storage, and consumers that read and process the data. Kafka's fault-tolerant design and scalability make it ideal for data streaming and processing applications.

# Integrating CDC with Apache Kafka

To effectively integrate CDC with Kafka, organizations need to evaluate suitable CDC solutions compatible with the Kafka ecosystem. These solutions should align with specific requirements and use cases, ensuring seamless data flow from source to target. Configuring and setting up CDC for Kafka involves defining topics, and partitions, and establishing data replication between sources and targets.

# Ingesting Data using CDC in Apache Kafka

Once the CDC is set up, the process of ingesting data into Kafka begins. Let's consider a practical example of how CDC can be implemented to ingest data from a relational database (MySQL) into Apache Kafka.

# CDC Implementation from MySQL to Apache Kafka and PostgreSQL using Docker

**Step 1: Setting up the Environment**

Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.

**Step 2: Create a working directory**

Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it:

```bash
$ mkdir kafka-cdc-postgres-demo
$ cd kafka-cdc-postgres-demo
```

**Step 3: Create a** `docker-compose.yml` **file with necessary services.**

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3.7'

services:
  # Define services for ZooKeeper, Kafka, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Kafka Connect
  # ...

networks:
  kafka-network:
    driver: bridge
```

**Step 4: Start the Docker containers**

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

**Step 5: Enable CDC in MySQL**

Since we are using the Debezium MySQL Connector, CDC must be enabled in MySQL. Connect to the MySQL container using a MySQL client (e.g., MySQL Workbench) with the credentials provided in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

Edit the MySQL configuration file (my.cnf) to include the following lines:

```ini
[mysqld]
server-id=1
log_bin=/var/lib/mysql/mysql-bin.log
binlog-format=row
```

After making these changes, restart the MySQL container:

```bash
$ docker-compose restart mysql
```

**Step 6: Set up Debezium Connector for MySQL**

Create a new file called `mysql-connector.json` inside the `kafka-cdc-postgres-demo` directory and paste the following content:

```json
{
  "name": "mysql-connector",
  "config": {
    "connector.class": "io.debezium.connector.mysql.MySqlConnector",
    "tasks.max": "1",
    "database.hostname": "mysql",
    "database.port": "3306",
    "database.user": "your_mysql_username",
    "database.password": "your_mysql_password",
    "database.server.id": "1",
    "database.server.name": "mysql_cdc",
    "database.include.list": "your_database_name",
    "table.include.list": "your_database_name.your_table_name",
    "database.history.kafka.bootstrap.servers": "kafka:9092",
    "database.history.kafka.topic": "schema-changes.your_database_name",
    "transforms": "unwrap",
    "transforms.unwrap.type": "io.debezium.transforms.ExtractNewRecordState",
    "key.converter": "org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter",
    "value.converter": "org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter",
    "key.converter.schemas.enable": "false",
    "value.converter.schemas.enable": "false"
  }
}
```

Make sure to replace the placeholders (e.g., `your_mysql_username`, `your_mysql_password`, `your_database_name`, and `your_table_name`) with the actual MySQL credentials and database information.

**Step 7: Set up Debezium Connector for PostgreSQL**

Create a new file called `postgres-connector.json` inside the `kafka-cdc-postgres-demo` directory and paste the following content:

```json
{
  "name": "postgres-connector",
  "config": {
    "connector.class": "io.debezium.connector.postgresql.PostgresConnector",
    "tasks.max": "1",
    "database.hostname": "postgres",
    "database.port": "5432",
    "database.user": "your_postgres_username",
    "database.password": "your_postgres_password",
    "database.dbname": "your_postgres_database_name",
    "database.server.name": "postgres_cdc",
    "table.include.list": "public.your_table_name",
    "database.history.kafka.bootstrap.servers": "kafka:9092",
    "database.history.kafka.topic": "schema-changes.postgres",
    "transforms": "unwrap",
    "transforms.unwrap.type": "io.debezium.transforms.ExtractNewRecordState",
    "key.converter": "org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter",
    "value.converter": "org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter",
    "key.converter.schemas.enable": "false",
    "value.converter.schemas.enable": "false"
  }
}
```

Make sure to replace the placeholders (e.g., `your_postgres_username`, `your_postgres_password`, `your_postgres_database_name`, and `your_table_name`) with the actual PostgreSQL credentials and database information.

**Step 8: Start the Debezium Connectors**

Run the following commands to start the Debezium Connectors for MySQL and PostgreSQL:

```bash
$ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data @mysql-connector.json http://localhost:8083/connectors
$

 curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data @postgres-connector.json http://localhost:8083/connectors
```

**Step 9: Verify CDC data in Kafka and PostgreSQL**

You can use a Kafka consumer to read the data from the "cdc\_topic" and verify that the CDC data from MySQL is being ingested into Kafka successfully. Run the following command to start a Kafka consumer:

```bash
$ docker-compose exec kafka /usr/bin/kafka-console-consumer --bootstrap-server kafka:9092 --topic cdc_topic --from-beginning
```

Additionally, you can connect to the PostgreSQL container using a PostgreSQL client (e.g., pgAdmin) and verify that the data from Kafka is being written to the specified table.

**NB**: This example provides a high-level overview of the steps involved without detailed implementation. Make sure to replace placeholders with actual values in configuration files. Remember that setting up a full CDC pipeline involves intricate configuration and considerations, especially when dealing with real-world databases and environments. This example simplifies the process and may need adjustments based on your specific use case and requirements
